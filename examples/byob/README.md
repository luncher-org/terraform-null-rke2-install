# Bring Your Own Binary Example

In this example, you have chosen to provide your own files rather than the module downloading them from GitHub.
We make some assumptions in order to limit "works on my machine" issues.

This example is tested using Terratest, please see the `./tests` directory for more information.
You can run this test by navigating to the `./tests` directory and running `go test -v -parallel=10 -timeout=30m -run TestByob`.
