# Bring Your Own Binary Example

In this example, you have chosen to provide your own files rather than the module downloading them from GitHub.
We make some assumptions in order to limit "works on my machine" issues.

Assumptions:

- you do not have public internet access
- you are able to connect to the server you want to install on
- you are not running from the server to install on
- you have downloaded the files necessary
  - we assume each file is archived using `.tar.gz`
- you have Nix installed and you are in the nix-shell generated by the flake.nix file in the base of this repo
  - you may also just install the requirements (listed in the flake.nix) to the system running Terraform
  - the CI we use is the GitHub ubuntu-latest runner which has everything pre-installed
- you are sourcing the .envrc and you have the proper rc files in the proper places so they can be sourced as well
  - this generally applies to third party services that Terraform must access in order to work
  - we try to provide as much configuration of Terraform providers in environment variables as possible
- you are using the latest version of Terraform (or at least the latest version published to Nix packages)
  - minimally version `1.2`, we test on `1.5+`

## Known Issues

* Terraform artifacts: if you don't have a public internet connection you will need to download the terraform providers necessary for this module to work
  * see https://somspeaks.com/terraform-offline-setup-and-initialization/ as a pretty good tutorial
  * official documentation:
